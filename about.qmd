# ðŸ‘‹ Thomas Wyndham Bush

**Student and Research Assistant in ML & Neuroscience**

I'm a researcher exploring the intersection of machine learning, computational neuroscience, and language. I build tools for analyzing behavior, neural data, and AI explainability.

This site collects my articles, experiments, and thoughts as I learn and build in the open.
