We do not have to know everything about something in order to understan it. The reader is much more like the catcher in a game of baseball, the art of reading is the skill of catching every sort of communication.

We can roughly define what we mean by the art of reading as follows:

> The process whereby a mind, with nothing to operate onside, elevates itself by the power of its own operations. The mind passes from understanding less to understanding more. The skilled operations that cause this to happen are the varios acts that consituite the art of reading.
> 

For reading for understanding there is initial inequality in understanding, the writer must be superior, and in a second moment the reader must overcome this inequity. The art of reading include all of the same skills that are involved in discovery.

**Levels of reading:**

- Elementary reading

Understand the word, and kwon the meaning of the majority of the words. 

- Inspectional reading:
    
    The inspectional reading include elementary reading, and is inclueded in analytical reading.
    
    There are two steps for superficial reading:
    
    1. skimming:
    
    Your main aim is to discover whether the book requires a more careful reading and also tell you lots of other things about the book. Steps of skimming:
    
    - Look at the title page and, if the book has one, at its preface
    - Study the table of contents: to obtain a general sense of the book's structure.
    - Check the index: When you see terms listed that seem crucial, look up at least some of the passages cited. The passages you read may contain the crux- the point on wich the book hinges- or the new departure which is the key to the author's approach and attitude.
    - Read the publisher's blurb: it is not uncommon for authors to try to summarize as accurately as they can the main points in their book.
    - From your general and still rather vague knowledge of the book's, look now at the chapters that seem to be pivotal to its argument.
    - Turn the pages, dipping in here and there, reading a paragraph or two, sometimes several pages in sequence, never more than that. Looking for signs of the main contention. Do not fail to read the last two or three pages, few authotd are able to resist the temptation to sum up what thei think is the new and important about their work in these pages.
    1. superficial reading:
    
    Tackling a difficult book for the first time, read it through without ever stopping to look up or ponder the things you do not understand right away. So you won't miss the forest fo the trees.
    
    Systematic skimming anticipates the comprehension of a book's structure and the superficial reading serves the reader when he comes to the second stage of reading at the analytical reading.
    
    **Reading speeds:** different speeds for different books, and also the spee will change in differt part of the book.
    
- How to be a demanding reader:
    
    The four basic questions a reader asks, ask these questions while you read:
    
    1. **What is the book about as a whole?**
    2. **What is being said in detail and how?**
    3. **Is the book true, in whole or part?**
    4. **What of it?** why does the author think it is importatnt to know these things?
    
    An analytical reading of a book has not been accomplished until you have answers to those last questions.
    
- How to mark your own book
    - underlining
    - vertical lines at the margin
    - star
    - numbers in the margin
    - CF to indicate the other pages number
    - writing in the margin or at the top or bottom.

The notes that you take during the inspectional reading are called: structure based notes. The notes during the analytical reading are called: concept based notes.

You have to build an habit based on the rules of reading, like the art of skiing, you have to create a single habit consitude of all these rules.

- Analytical reading:

The analytical reader must asj many, and organzed, questions of what he is reading. The analytical reading is the best reading that is possible given unlimited time.

- Syntopical reading

**Analytical reading:  Rules for finding what a book is about:**

- Rule 1. **You must know what kind of book are you reading, and you should know this as early in the process as possible, preferably before begin to read.**
    - The practical has to do with that works in some ways, they teach you how to do something.
    - The theoretical concerns something to be seen or understood, they teach you that something is the case.
    
    Kinds of theoretical books:
    
    - Historyalways deals with things that existed or events that occured on a particolar date and in a particolar place. **Chronotopic.**
    - Philosophy seeks general truths rather than an account of particular events.
    - Scientific: experience out of ordinary life, in laboratory for ex.
- Rule 2. **State the unity of the whole book in a single sentence, or at most a few sentences (a short paragraph)**
    
    Discover the main point or the theme of the book as a unity.
    
- Rule 3. **Set forth the major parts of the book, and show how these are organized into a whole, by being ordered to one another and the unity of th whole**
    
    Outline a book:
    
    You cannot comprehend a whole without somehow seeing its part, it means outling them, treating the parts as if they were suborfinate wholes, each with a unity and complexity of its own.
    
    Ex: The authors accomplished this plan in five major parts, of wich the first part is about so and so, the second part is about such and such. The first part is divided in thee sections, of wich the first coniders X, the second considers Y and the third considers Z. In the first section of the first part the authors makes four points, of wich the first is A, the second is B and the third is C.
    
    Thid is only a formula, you can adapt it to your reading . 
    
- Rule 4. **Find out what the author's problems were**
    
    List of question that you should question to the book and to yourself during the reading:
    
    Theoretical question
    
    - Does something exist?
    - What kind of thing is it?
    - What caused it to exist?
    - What purpose does it serve?
    - What are consenquence of its existence?
    - What are its relations to other things of a similar sort?
    - How does it behave?
    
    Practical question:
    
    - What ends should be sought?
    - What means should be chosen to a given end?
    - Undert these conditions what is the right thing to do?
    - Under what condonsions would it be better do this rather than that?
    

**The second stage of analytical reading: Rules for interpreting a book's contents:**

- Come to terms with the author by interpreting his keywords
    
    Unless the reader comes to terms with the author, the communication of knowledge from one to the other does not take place.
    
    A term is not a word, if the author uses a word in one meaning and the reader reads it another, words have passed between them, but they have not come to terms. So long as amibiguity persist, there is no meaning in common between writer and reader, it is necessary for the two parties to use the same words with the same meanings. A term is a word used unambiguosly.
    
    You must spot the important words in a boook and figure out how the author is using them, there are two partes: 1) locate the important words, 2) determine the meaning of these words, as used, with precision.
    
    The main point is that one word cam be the vehicle for many terms, and one term can be expressed by many words. ex: "we have a word X that can express three terms: a, b, c. Now if we use the word to express the term a we will have Xa, if you instead read Xb, we are not communicate, becuase is like speaking a different language."
    
    **finding the key words:** you cannot locate the key words without making an effort to understand the passage in wich they occur, if you mark the words that trouble you, you may hit the very ones the author using specially.
    
    **finding the meanings:** once you have marked the words that trouble you  there are two main possibilities: either the author is using these words in a single sense or he is using them in many sense. **You have to discover the meaning of a word you do not understand by using the meaning of all the other words in the context that you di understand.**
    
- Grasp the author's leading proposition by dealing with his most important sentences
    
    The proposition are nothing but expression of personal opinion unless they are supported by reasons. Every sort of argument consists of a number of statements related in a certain way. We go from terms to proposition to arguments, by going from words (and phrase) to sentences to collection of of sentences. 
    
    Sentences and paragraphs are grammatical units. Propositions and arguments are logical units or units of knowledge. 
    
    **Mark the most important sentences in a book and discover the propositions they contain:**
    
    The sentences important for you are thoose that require an effort of interpretations, because at first sight they are not perfectly intelligible. For an author's point of view, the important sentences are the ones that express the judments on which his whole arguments rest. The heart of his communication lies in the major affirmations and denials he is making, and the reasons he gives fo so doing. You have to ask yourself questions about the meaning of a passage. 
    
    Once that you have discovered the importants sentences you must discover the proposition that each of these sentences contains. You discover propositions by interpreting all the words that make up the sentence, and especially its principal words.
    
    **State in your own words.** if you cannot get away at all from the author's words, it shows that only words have passed from him to you, not knowledge.
    
- Know the author's arguments, by finding them in, or constructing them out of, sequences of sentences
    
    **Find the paragraphs in a book that state its important arguments,** if the arguments is not expressed your task is to construct them by taking a sentence from this paragraph and one from that, until you have gathered toghter the sequence of sentences that state the propositions that compose the arguments.
    
    Discover the leading sentences⇒put numbers in the margin, together with other marks, to indicate the places where the sentences occur that should be tied together in a sequence.
    
    1. every arguments must involve a number of statements 
    2. discriminate between the kind of argument that points to one or more particolar facts as evidence for some generalization and the kind that offers a series of general statements to prove some further genetalizations.
    3. observe what things the author says he must assume. 
- Determine wich of his problems the author has solved, and wich he has not; and ad to the latter, decide which the author he had failed to solve
    
    

**The third stage of analytical reading: Rules for criticizing a book as a communication of knowledge:**

**part A: General maxims of intellectual etiquette**

- Do not begin criticism until you have completed your outline and your interpretation of the book.
    
    Reading a book is a kind of conversation, so you have the responsibility of taking a position. When you take it, it is yours, not the author's. You must be able to say, with reasonable certainty, "i understand" before you can say one of the following things: "i agree" or "i disagree" or "i suspend judgment".
    
- Do not disagree disputatiosly or contentiously
    
    When you disagree, do so reasonbly, and not disputatiously or contentiously.
    
- Demonstrate that you recognize the differences between knowledge and mere personal opinion by presenting good reasons for any critical judgment you make
    
    Do not disagree hopelessly, The relatively ignorant often wrongly disagree with the relatively learned about matters exceeding thei knowledge. Theu think that everything is just a matter of opinion. I have mine, and you have yours. You have to dinstict between real knowledge and mere opinion. Respect the difference between knowledge and mere personal opinion by giving reasons for any critical judgment you make. Knowledge consist in those opinions that can be defended , opinions for wich there is evidence of one kind or another.
    

Summarize the rules for critical reading:

The first requires the reader to complete the task of understanding before rushing in. The second adjures him not to be disputatious or contentious. The third one asks him to view disagreement about matters of knowledge as being generally remediable. It also commands him to give reasons for his disagreements so that issues are not merely stated but also defined, in hope for resolution.

**part B: special criteria for points of criticism**

If, in addition to understanding a book, you agree thoroughly with what the author says, the work is over. The analytical reading is completely done. Understanding a book can be describe as a kind of agreement between writer and reader. They agree about the useo of language to express ideas. because of that agreement, the reader is able to see through the author's language to the ideas he is trying to express.

There are three conditions that must be satisfied if controversy is to be well conducted:

- First it is necessary to acknowledge the emotions you bring to a dispute, or those that arise in the course of it.
- Second you must make your own assumptions explicit. you must know what your prejudicices are. Otherwise your are not likely to admit that your opponent may be equally entitled to different assumptions.
- Third, an attempt at impartiality is a good antidote for the blindness that is almost inevitable in partisanship.
- Show wherein the author is uninformed
    
    He lacks some piece of knowledge that is relevant to the problem he is trying to solve. To support the remark, you must be able yourself to state the knowledge that author lacks and show how relevant.
    
- Show wherein the author is misinformed
    
    Is to say he asserts what is not the case, he is claiming to have knowledge he does not posses. You must be able to argue the truth.
    
- Show wherein the author is illogical
    
    Is to say that he has committed a fallacy in reasoning, wich means that what is drawn as conclusion simply does not follow from the reasons offered. The two things the author has tried to say are incompatible.
    
- Show wherein the author's analysis or account is incomplete
    
    Is to say that he has not solved all the problems he started with, or that he has not made as good use of his materials as possible, that he did not see all their implications and ramifications, or that he has failed to make distinctions that are relevant to his undertaking. this point remark ties together the three stages of analytical reading of any book. The last step of structural outlining is to know the problems that the author is trying to solve. The last step of interpretation is to know wich of these problems the author solved and wich he did not.
